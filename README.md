The (not so) long awaited sequel to my [Valorant Comms Bot](https://github.com/CattoYT/ValorantCommsBot), Universal Comms Bot! (someone dm me a better name PLEASE)

A :fire:blazingly fast:fire: CV project to communicate with teammates in games.

Notes

## League
For league detection, please run the minimap at max size. Also if you dont have a 1080p monitor then erm gl bro
Also u need to use (borderless) fullscreen
