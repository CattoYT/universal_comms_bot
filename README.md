# Universal Comms Bot

The (not so) long awaited sequel to my [Valorant Comms Bot](https://github.com/CattoYT/ValorantCommsBot), Universal Comms Bot! (someone dm me a better name PLEASE)

A :fire:blazingly fast:fire: CV project to communicate with teammates in games.

TODO:
- [] Send frames to the processor_shared crate somehow (figure it out fool)
- [] Allow for sending frames over network and processing them
- [] actually do something with the frames
